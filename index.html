            <p><b>Intresting Facts About Pigeon</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
                <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>

            <p><b>Intresting Facts About Teddy Bear</b></p>
            <ul>

                <li>The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.</li>
                <li>The official term for a teddy bear collector is an ‘arctophile’.</li>

            <p><b>Intresting Facts About Cicada</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The length of a cicada's life depends upon the cicada species. Cicadas in the genus Magicicada (the periodical cicadas) if left undisturbed in their nymphal, below ground habitat will live about 13 or 17 years, depending on the species.</li>
                <li>Five eyes: cicadas have five eyes: two obvious, large, compound eyes, and three ocelli. Ocelli are three jewel-like eyes situated between the two main, compound eyes of a cicada. We believe ocelli are used to detect light and darkness.</li>
                <li>After the long 2 to 17 years, cicadas emerge from the ground as nymphs. Nymphs climb the nearest available vertical surface (usually a plant) and begin to shed their nymph exoskeleton.</li>
